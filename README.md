# CRU
 Scripts for Climatic Research Unit

This repository aims  to collect, manipulate, and generate variables related to climatic shocks on AMC (Comparable Minimum Areas) in Brazil.
The following tasks will be implemented.

* Collect data [Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI)](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/drought/).
* Collect data [CRU TS Version 4.05)](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.05/).
* Collect data from Brazilian maps defining the geographical boundaries of the AMC from [Ehrl, Philipp (2017) Minimum Comparable Areas (AMC)](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/research "Ehrl, Philipp (2017) Minimum comparable areas for the period 1872-2010: an aggregation of Brazilian municipalities").
* Combine grids within areas, generate statistics, and build historical data.
* Collapse historical data as panel data at the quarterly frequency and at AMC level.
